# Directions for Over the Wire in Seminar CS
---

In general, you will need to use the command "ssh -p 2220 bandit\#@bandit.labs.overthewire.com" to log in to a challenge.

bandit\# is the username you are attempting to login as.  The \# will be the number of the level you are working on.

For the first challenge, use bandit0 as both the username and password.

For each challenge, you should fill in the command you used, a brief explanation of what your command does, and the password you found.  Give you answers each in a single line (this will facilitate my grading).  Commit a change, with a comment, after you solve each challenge.

Before starting the challenges, fill in your name in the line below (First Last).
